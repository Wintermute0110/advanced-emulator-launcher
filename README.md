# Advanced Kodi Launcher #

Multi-emulator front-end and general application launcher for Kodi, based and build upon AEL (Advanced Emulator Launcher). 
It is a modulair build with support for many plugins to either launch, scan or scrape ROMs and games from your favourite source.  
Plugins are available for offline scrapers for MAME, scanners for No-Intro ROM sets and also support for scrapping ROM metadata and artwork from many different sources online. There is ROM auditing for No-Intro ROMs using No-Intro or Redump XML DAT files.  
Simply launching of games and standalone applications is also available.
