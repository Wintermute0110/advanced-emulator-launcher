# Advanced Emulator Launcher #

Multi-emulator front-end and general application launcher for Kodi. It is a modulair build with support for many plugins to either launch, scan or scrape ROMs and games from your favourite source.  
Plugins are available for offline scrapers for MAME, scanners for No-Intro ROM sets and also support for scrapping ROM metadata and artwork from many different sources online. There is ROM auditing for No-Intro ROMs using No-Intro or Redump XML DAT files.  
Simply launching of games and standalone applications is also available.

## Installing the latest released version ##

You can install this [repository](https://github.com/chrisism/repository.chrisism) locally in Kodi to install and keep it up to date. Or follow [this link](https://github.com/chrisism/repository.chrisism/tree/master/plugin.program.AEL) 
and download the ZIP file of the version you want. Use this ZIP file to install the addon in Kodi.

## Installing the latest development version ##

It is important that you follow this instructions or Advanced Emulator Launcher won't work well. Make sure you select the 'master-fork' branch.

  1) In this page click on the green button `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`

  2) Uncompress this ZIP file. This will create a folder named `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher-master`

  3) Rename that folder to `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher`

  4) Compress that folder again into a ZIP file. 

  5) In Kodi, use that ZIP file (and not the original one) to install the plugin in `System` --> `Addons` 
     --> `Install from ZIP file`.

  6) You are done!

## Install plugins
Just like the addon itself you can use the repository as mentioned above. If you want to install it manually, go to [this link](https://github.com/chrisism/repository.chrisism) and select of the script.ael.*** plugins.
